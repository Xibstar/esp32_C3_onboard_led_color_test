# YD-ESP32-C3 RGB LED Color Cycle

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to control the onboard RGB LED of the YD-ESP32-C3 board by cycling through various colors. It uses the Adafruit NeoPixel library to showcase basic RGB LED manipulation in embedded systems.

## Features
- Cycles the onboard RGB LED through red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, magenta, and white colors.
- Each color displays for 500 milliseconds.
- Implements the Adafruit NeoPixel library for effective LED control.

## Hardware Requirements
- YD-ESP32-C3 Development Board

## Software Requirements
- PlatformIO IDE or Arduino IDE
- Adafruit NeoPixel library

## PlatformIO Environment Setup
- Set the environment to `[env:esp32-c3-devkitm-1]` in the `platformio.ini` file to match the YD-ESP32-C3 board specifications.

## Setup
1. Ensure the Adafruit NeoPixel library is installed in your PlatformIO or Arduino IDE environment.
2. Compile and upload the code to the YD-ESP32-C3 board.

## Usage
Once the code is uploaded, the onboard RGB LED on the YD-ESP32-C3 board will automatically start cycling through the colors.
